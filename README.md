# Vidsrc.to Resolver/CLI
*A simple cli for fetching content from vidsrc.to by resolving m3u8's from common sources used by the site.*

---

### Info
*While I plan on maintaining this for the foreseeable future, please note that I do intend to eventually archive this and merge all the work here into a package consisting of all other sources I have previously worked on.*

*Consider this a usable public dev build, I wont be pushing any breaking changes.*
